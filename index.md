## Short Bio

I am a PhD student at INRIA Rennes, in the Linkmedia team headed by Laurent Amsaleg. I am supervised by Teddy FURON and Erwan LE MERRER. My work focuses on neural network security. I create attacks to fool an AI, and defenses to make them more robust.

I received my engineering degree from Phelma, a member of Grenoble-INP. I acquired skills in signal and image processing, and in electronics. I then wanted to go further into the field of artificial intelligence. For that, I worked 4 years in xBrain, a company working in natural language processing. I worked on many projects such as text classification, POS or knowledge discovery. I was also able to work on the production implementation of my solutions. This allowed me to know the best practices in programming.

Following this very good experience, I confirmed my desire to learn more about AI and how it works. This led to the beginning of a PhD. I started this PhD in September 2020, and I have already published 2 papers. I invite you to go and see them here.
